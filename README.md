# Data Science Demystified 

I attended a Data Science Workshop -- "Data Science Demystified" and learnt the fundementals of data science along with how to conduct an exploratory data analysis with the Iris Flower Dataset. It was a 5-day Workshop filled with many fun activities and learning oppurtunities which helped me enter into the world of Data Science smoothly.

This repository contains the EDA done in python during the hands-on session in this workshop.
